 ## Examples

 Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because that 
<example>
<user:input>
    Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>
<score>4</score>
<score_reasons>
-BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank
-BAD: the beginner is uncessray,should just start showing the vocabulary table 
-BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
-BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that conceptual like this :[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

 Let's start with the vocabulary. Here's a table to help you:
| Japanese  | Romaji    | English|
| 熊	     | kuma	    |  bear |
| ドア	     | doa      |  door |
| 居る	     | iru	    |  to be, to exist|
| 出す	     | dasu	    | to take out|
| ゴミ	     | gomi	    | garbage|
| 忘れる	 | wasureru	 | to forget |

Now, let's break down the sentence. We have two parts:
"Bears are at the door" - This part is describing a situation. Think about how to use the verb (to be, to exist) to describe where something is.
"Did you leave the garbage out?" - This part is a question. Think about how to use the verb (to take out) and the verb (to forget) to ask if someone did something.
Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Location] ni [object] ga [verb] ( Location has object )
[You] wa [object] o [verb] (ni) [location] ka? (Did you verb object at location?)
Can you try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary and sentence structure above?

  [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?
  Considerations:
  - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by comma
  - The first part is stating a location where something exists
  - The second part is asking about a past action

  Possible next steps:
  - attempt an answer
  - ask clues about location marking
  - ask clues about how to connect two sentences 
  - ask clues about question formation
  - ask clues about verb conjugation
 Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
